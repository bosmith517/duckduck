IMPORTANT: You were viewing an OLD BUILD from July 4th!

The issue was that you were seeing a cached production build in the 'dist' folder
instead of the live development server.

To fix this:

1. STOP your current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. Run the START_DEV_MODE.bat file I created
   - This will delete old builds
   - Clear caches  
   - Start fresh development server

3. You should see output like:
   VITE v6.3.5  ready in X ms
   âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/

4. NOW when you access http://localhost:5173/team/members you will see:
   - Green success banner at the top
   - "Team Directory - LIVE UPDATE TEST" as the title
   - Console logs when clicking buttons

The changes I made today at 7:00 AM are definitely in the TeamPage.tsx file,
but you were viewing a build from July 4th!

If you still have issues after running START_DEV_MODE.bat, the server might be
running somewhere else. In that case, please share what process is using port 5173.
